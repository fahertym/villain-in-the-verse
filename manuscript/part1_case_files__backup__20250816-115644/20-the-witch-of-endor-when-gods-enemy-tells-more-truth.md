## Chapter 20: The Witch of Endor - When God's Enemy Tells More Truth

1 Samuel 28 is where the Bible accidentally admits that sometimes the people God condemns are more honest than the people God chooses. It's the story of King Saul, abandoned by God, seeking answers from a medium he's supposed to execute, who successfully summons the prophet Samuel from the dead to deliver devastating truth. The "witch" God's law demands be killed provides more accurate divine information than God Himself was willing to give.

This isn't just about necromancy. It's about God creating information vacuums that drive desperate people to forbidden sources, then punishing them for seeking what He refused to provide. It's divine ghosting followed by rage when you text someone else.

### The Setup: God's Silent Treatment

"When Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets."

Saul's facing the Philistine army. He's terrified. He seeks God through every legitimate channel:
- Dreams (the traditional revelation method)
- Urim (the official priestly divination tool)
- Prophets (the authorized spokespeople)

God refuses all communication. Radio silence. The king of God's chosen people, facing existential threat, gets voicemail on every divine hotline.

This is the same God who'll later claim "I never leave nor forsake you." He's literally forsaking Saul at the moment of greatest need. Not because Saul stopped seeking Him—Saul's desperately trying every approved method. God's just not taking calls from this number anymore.

### The Illegal Solution

Desperate, Saul does what desperate people do: he seeks help wherever he can find it. He asks his servants to find a medium—someone who can contact the dead. This despite the fact that Saul himself had "put the mediums and the necromancers out of the land" on God's orders.

The irony is thick: the king who expelled mediums now needs one because God won't talk to him.

His servants immediately know where to find one: "Behold, there is a medium at Endor."

Either Saul's purge was incompetent, or his servants always kept a backup medium's number handy. Smart money's on the latter—when official channels fail, you need unofficial options.

### The Witch Who Wasn't Wrong

Saul disguises himself and visits the medium at night. She's rightfully paranoid:

"Surely you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off the mediums and the necromancers from the land. Why then are you laying a trap for my life to bring about my death?"

She knows the penalty for her profession: death. She knows this could be entrapment. But Saul swears by the Lord (ironic, given the Lord won't talk to him) that she won't be punished.

She asks who to bring up. Saul says Samuel. The moment Samuel appears, she realizes she's been tricked—this is Saul himself. She's terrified, but Saul tells her not to fear and asks what she sees.

"I see a god coming up out of the earth... An old man is coming up, and he is wrapped in a robe."

She succeeds. She actually contacts Samuel. The medium God's law says should die successfully does what God's priests couldn't: provide supernatural communication.

### Samuel Spills the Truth Tea

Samuel's ghost is cranky: "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?"

Saul explains his desperation—the Philistines, God's silence, the complete abandonment. Samuel's response is brutal honesty:

"Why then do you ask me, since the Lord has turned from you and become your enemy?"

There it is. God isn't just silent—He's actively Saul's enemy. The divine protection racket has moved from withdrawal of services to active hostility.

Samuel continues the devastating prophecy:
- The Lord has torn the kingdom from Saul and given it to David
- Tomorrow Saul and his sons will die
- Israel will be defeated by the Philistines

Every word comes true. The illegal medium's illegal séance produces 100% accurate prophecy.

### The Witch's Unexpected Mercy

After delivering the worst news of Saul's life, the medium notices he's about to collapse. He hasn't eaten all day and night. This woman—who Saul tried to exterminate, who could be executed for her actions, who he just tricked—shows him compassion:

"Let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way."

She kills her own fattened calf, bakes bread, and feeds the man who wanted her dead. The "witch" shows more mercy than God. The criminal shows more compassion than the divine.

### The Pattern Recognition

This story reveals multiple damning truths:

**God creates the problems He punishes**: Refuses communication, driving Saul to forbidden sources, then punishes him for seeking them.

**Forbidden sources sometimes work better**: The medium succeeds where priests failed. The illegal provides what the legal couldn't.

**God's enemies tell more truth**: The medium and Samuel's ghost are more honest than God's silence.

**"Evil" people show more mercy than God**: The witch feeds her persecutor; God destroys His servant.

**Divine law creates the crimes it punishes**: Ban mediums, create desperate need for mediums, punish medium use.

### The Theological Nightmare

This story breaks multiple theological claims:

If mediums are frauds, how did she summon Samuel?
If necromancy is evil, why did it work?
If God wants people to seek Him alone, why does He go silent?
If consulting the dead is forbidden, why does it provide accurate information?
If God is merciful, why is the witch more merciful?

The apologetics are desperate:
- "It wasn't really Samuel"—The text says it was
- "God allowed it as judgment"—So God uses forbidden practices He condemns?
- "It was a demon impersonating Samuel"—Who gave 100% accurate prophecy?
- "The witch was still evil"—But more helpful than God?

### What This Actually Teaches

The Witch of Endor story accidentally admits:

- Forbidden knowledge sometimes works
- God's silence drives people to extremes
- Divine law creates criminals out of desperate people
- Those God condemns may be more helpful than God
- Mercy comes from unexpected sources when God withdraws it

Every person driven to psychics because prayer failed, every desperate soul seeking answers in forbidden places because approved sources went silent—they're all running Saul's program. And sometimes, like Saul, they find more truth in the forbidden than in the approved.

### The Modern Application

This dynamic still operates:

- Churches condemn therapy while offering no real help
- Religion bans questions then punishes those who seek answers elsewhere
- Faith demands exclusive loyalty then goes silent during crises
- Believers driven to "secular" sources find more help than in prayer
- The condemned (scientists, psychologists, "worldly" wisdom) provide what churches can't

Every time someone says "I found more help from my therapist than from prayer," they're in Endor with Saul. Every time forbidden knowledge proves more useful than approved doctrine, that's the witch providing what God won't.

**If a Human Did This**: If a leader cut off communication during a crisis, driving subordinates to seek help from criminals, then punished them for it while the criminals proved more helpful, we'd call it abandonment and entrapment, not leadership.

**Apology Box**: "But Saul had previously disobeyed God!"
So the punishment for past disobedience is silence when seeking obedience? That's not correction—it's abandonment. Also, if God's forgiveness is conditional on perfect obedience, it's not forgiveness—it's a performance review.

**Exhibit A**: 1 Samuel 28:6-7—"When Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim or by prophets. Then Saul said to his servants, 'Seek out for me a woman who is a medium, that I may go to her and inquire of her.'" God's silence drives Saul to the very practice God forbids, creating the sin He'll punish.
