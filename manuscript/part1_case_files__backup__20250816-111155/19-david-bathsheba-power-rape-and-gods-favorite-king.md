## Chapter 19: David & Bathsheba - Power, Rape, and God's Favorite King

2 Samuel 11-12 contains one of the Bible's most disturbing abuse stories, made worse by how it's traditionally taught. David—"a man after God's own heart"—sees a woman bathing, uses his royal power to rape her, murders her husband to cover it up, and God's response is... to kill their baby but let David keep the throne.

This isn't a story of adultery and redemption. It's about power rape, murder, and a God who punishes the victim's child while protecting the perpetrator king.

### The View from the Palace

"In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, David sent Joab... But David remained at Jerusalem."

David's supposed to be at war but stays home instead. One evening, he's walking on his roof and sees a woman bathing. The text identifies her as "Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite."

She's named as someone's daughter and someone's wife—establishing that David knows she's married. Uriah is one of David's mighty men, currently fighting David's war while David stalks his wife from the palace roof.

David "sent messengers and took her."

"Took." Not "invited." Not "seduced." Took. When the king's soldiers show up to "take" you to the palace, that's not a request. That's a command backed by lethal force.

### The Rape Nobody Calls Rape

"She came to him, and he lay with her."

Churches call this adultery. It's not. Adultery requires consent. When you're summoned by absolute power, taken by armed guards, and "laid with" by a king who can have you killed, that's rape.

Bathsheba had no choice. Refuse the king? Death. Report the king? To whom? Fight back? Against the man who commands the army?

The power differential makes consent impossible. It's like calling it "adultery" when a prisoner "seduces" a guard, or a child "tempts" an adult. The person with power is always the perpetrator, not the co-conspirator.

After the rape: "Then she returned to her house."

She's sent home like nothing happened. Used and discarded. Until...

"The woman conceived, and she sent and told David, 'I am pregnant.'"

Now David has a problem. The rape produced evidence.

### The Cover-Up Murder

David's solution isn't confession or repentance. It's conspiracy and murder:

1. **Brings Uriah home from war**—Maybe he'll sleep with his wife and think the baby is his
2. **Uriah refuses to go home**—He won't enjoy comfort while his comrades fight
3. **David gets him drunk**—Still won't go home to Bathsheba
4. **David orders his murder**—Sends Uriah back with his own death warrant

The letter to Joab says: "Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die."

David uses the war he's supposed to be fighting to murder the man whose wife he raped. Uriah dies carrying his own death sentence, killed for the crime of having a wife the king wanted.

### God's Response: Kill the Baby

Nathan the prophet confronts David with a parable about a rich man stealing a poor man's lamb. David's furious at the injustice—"The man who did this deserves to die!"

Nathan reveals: "You are the man!"

Finally, consequences? Divine justice? God's wrath on the rapist-murderer?

Nope. Here's God's judgment:

1. **David keeps the throne**—No abdication required
2. **David keeps his life**—Despite saying the perpetrator deserves death
3. **David keeps Bathsheba**—He marries his rape victim
4. **The baby dies**—The infant pays for David's crimes

"The Lord struck the child that Uriah's wife bore to David, and it became ill."

For seven days, the baby suffers while David fasts and prays. Then the baby dies. The innocent infant, product of rape, pays the ultimate price while the rapist-king gets to rule for decades more.

### The Victim Becomes a Prop

Bathsheba's grief isn't mentioned. Her trauma isn't addressed. She's raped, widowed, forced to marry her rapist, then watches her baby die for her rapist's sins. Her pain is invisible in the text.

Instead, we get David's grief, David's fasting, David's prayers. When the baby dies, David gets up, washes, eats, and worships. His servants are confused—why mourn before death but not after?

David's response: "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, 'Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again?"

It's sociopathic pragmatism. The baby's dead, mourning won't help, time to move on. Then: "David comforted his wife, Bathsheba, and went in to her and lay with her, and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon."

"Comforted." He raped her, killed her husband, caused her baby's death, and now he "comforts" her with more sex that produces Solomon—who becomes God's chosen heir.

### The Apologetics Make It Worse

"David repented!"—For murder, not rape. Psalm 51, his supposed repentance, never mentions Bathsheba.

"Bathsheba seduced him!"—She was BATHING. In her own home. Existing while female isn't seduction.

"It was adultery, not rape!"—Power makes consent impossible. Kings don't commit adultery with subjects; they commit rape.

"The baby would have suffered!"—So kill it? That's the divine solution?

"David was punished!"—He ruled for decades more, died peacefully in bed, and is remembered as Israel's greatest king.

### What This Reveals About God's Justice

- Rape a woman: keep your throne
- Murder her husband: keep your life
- Cause a baby's death: keep God's favor
- Be the victim: lose your husband, baby, and autonomy
- Be the baby: die for your father's crimes

This is divine justice? The rapist-murderer gets a stern talking-to while innocents die?

God could have:
- Removed David from power
- Saved Uriah
- Protected Bathsheba
- Spared the baby
- Actually delivered justice

Instead, He protects the powerful predator and punishes the powerless victims.

**If a Human Did This**: If any leader raped a subordinate's wife, murdered the subordinate, and caused an infant's death, we'd call them a monster. If a judge let them keep power while killing their baby as "punishment," we'd call it travesty of justice.

**Apology Box**: "But David was God's chosen king!"
That makes it worse. If God's chosen can rape and murder with minimal consequences, what does that say about God's character? About His justice? About His concern for victims?

**Exhibit A**: 2 Samuel 12:13-14—"David said to Nathan, 'I have sinned against the Lord.' And Nathan said to David, 'The Lord also has put away your sin; you shall not die. Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child who is born to you shall die.'" The rapist lives, the baby dies. That's biblical justice.
