## Chapter 18: The Census Plague - David Counts, Thousands Die

2 Samuel 24 (paralleled in 1 Chronicles 21) contains one of the Bible's most bizarre atrocities: God incites David to take a census, then kills 70,000 people for David obeying. It's entrapment followed by collective punishment, where God plays both arsonist and firefighter, then demands worship for putting out the fire He started.

The story is so problematic that Chronicles tries to blame Satan instead, but that just makes it worse—now God either can't tell the difference between His own commands and Satan's, or He punishes people for obeying what they reasonably thought were His orders.

### The Divine Incitement

2 Samuel 24:1 is unambiguous:
"Again the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, 'Go, number Israel and Judah.'"

God is angry at Israel for unspecified reasons, so He incites David to take a census. The word "incited" is the same Hebrew word used when Satan incites Job's troubles. God is actively provoking David to do something that God will then punish.

But wait, 1 Chronicles 21:1 says:
"Then Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel."

So which is it? Did God incite David or did Satan? The answer doesn't matter because either way, 70,000 innocent people die for something they didn't do.

### The Crime That Isn't

What's wrong with taking a census? Governments need to know populations for taxation, military service, resource distribution. Moses took censuses on God's command (Numbers 1 and 26). Solomon will take one with no punishment (2 Chronicles 2:17).

The text never explains why THIS census is sinful. Commentators speculate:
- Maybe it showed lack of faith in God's protection
- Maybe it was for pride in military might
- Maybe it violated some unmentioned rule
- Maybe David didn't collect the census tax

But the real answer is: it doesn't matter. God incited it, then punished it. It's a setup.

### The Collective Punishment Special

After the census, David realizes he's sinned (how? the text doesn't say) and confesses. God, through the prophet Gad, offers David three punishments to choose from:

1. Three years of famine
2. Three months of fleeing from enemies
3. Three days of plague

Notice anything missing? Like, oh, I don't know, "David alone faces consequences for David's actions"? Every option punishes thousands or millions for one man's God-incited decision.

David chooses plague, saying "Let us fall into the hand of the Lord, for his mercy is great."

Mercy? God kills 70,000 people in three days. That's mercy?

### The Angel of Death's Greatest Hits

"So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time. And there died of the people from Dan to Beersheba 70,000 men."

Seventy thousand people. Dead. For a census they didn't take, many probably didn't even know about, that God incited in the first place.

These aren't soldiers who participated. They're farmers, merchants, women, children—anyone who happens to live in Israel. Their crime? Geographic proximity to David while he followed God's incitement.

The angel of death is about to destroy Jerusalem when God "relents from the calamity." Not because it's unjust—just because it's enough. Like someone beating a child who finally says "okay, that's sufficient abuse for today."

### David's Response: More Altars!

David sees the angel and offers to build an altar. He buys a threshing floor from Araunah the Jebusite, who offers it for free, but David insists on paying because "I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God that cost me nothing."

So David's takeaway from God killing 70,000 of his subjects is... I should pay full price for altar real estate? Not "this is unjust"? Not "why did innocents die for my action"? Not "why did You incite me then punish them"?

Nope. Build altar, sacrifice animals, problem solved. The 70,000 stay dead, but at least David paid market price for his worship spot.

### The Theological Pretzel

This story breaks theology:

If God incited it, why is it sin?
If Satan incited it, why does God honor it with punishment?
If David sinned, why do others die?
If census is wrong, why are other censuses commanded?
If God is just, where's the justice in collective punishment?

The apologetics for this are painful:
- "David's pride needed humbling"—so kill 70,000 others?
- "Israel had unspecified sins"—then punish them for those, not David's census
- "It shows God's sovereignty"—sovereignty includes entrapment and mass murder?
- "The people supported the census"—where does it say that?

### What This Actually Reveals

This story exposes the divine protection racket:

1. **Create the problem**: Incite David to take census
2. **Punish the action**: Kill thousands for the incited behavior
3. **Offer limited options**: Let David choose which mass death
4. **Stop eventually**: Relent after sufficient carnage
5. **Accept worship**: Let David build altars like that fixes anything

It's God creating disasters to demonstrate power, then accepting praise for eventually stopping the disaster He caused.

**If a Human Did This**: If a leader provoked someone into an action, then killed 70,000 citizens as punishment for that person obeying, we'd call it mass murder, entrapment, and crimes against humanity.

**Apology Box**: "But David should have known better!"
Known better than to obey what 2 Samuel says was God's direct incitement? How? Where's the manual for "when to ignore God's provocations"? And even if David should have known better, why do 70,000 others die for his failure?

**Exhibit A**: 2 Samuel 24:1, 15—"He incited David against them, saying, 'Go, number Israel and Judah.'... So the Lord sent a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time. And there died of the people from Dan to Beersheba 70,000 men." God incites, David obeys, thousands die. The causation is explicit.
