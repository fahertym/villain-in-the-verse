# Herod’s Massacre vs. God’s Silence

## The Setup
Matthew 2. A tyrant hunts an infant; Bethlehem bleeds.

## The Crime
Divine bystander problem: protect one, let others die.

## The Cover-Up
“Prophecy fulfilled” as consolation prize.

## If a Human Did This
Selective rescue to protect a favorite.

## Apology Box
“Free will of Herod.” Omniscience, omnipotence—no intervention?

*Receipts:* Matt 2:16–18

**One-liner:** Security detail for one, funeral for many.
