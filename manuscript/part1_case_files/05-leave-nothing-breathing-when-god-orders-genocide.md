## Part 5: Leave Nothing Breathing: When God Orders Genocide

When modern believers talk about the "difficult passages" in the Old Testament, they usually mean the ones where God seems "harsh" or "wrathful." What they're actually talking about—though few will say it plainly—are the multiple instances where God explicitly orders the complete extermination of entire peoples. Not defeat. Not conquest. Extermination.

These aren't metaphorical. They're not misunderstood. They're direct divine commands to commit what any international court would call genocide. And the instructions are specific: kill the men, kill the women, kill the children, kill the infants, kill the animals. Leave nothing breathing.

### The Amalekites: When Mercy Becomes Sin

1 Samuel 15 gives us the clearest example. God, speaking through the prophet Samuel, gives King Saul his mission:

> "Now go and strike Amalek and devote to destruction all that they have. Do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey."

Notice the specificity. This isn't military language about defeating an army. "Child and infant"—God wants the babies dead. The livestock too. Total erasure.

Saul follows orders mostly, but he spares the Amalekite king Agag and keeps the best livestock. For this act of relative mercy—for not completing the genocide thoroughly enough—God strips him of his kingship.

The moral here is explicit: showing mercy when God demands murder is the real sin. Incomplete genocide is worse than the genocide itself.

### The Midianites: Child Murder and Sex Slavery

Numbers 31 takes it further. After defeating the Midianites in battle, the Israelite soldiers bring back captives: women and children. Moses is furious:

> "Have you allowed all the women to live? Kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man intimately. But keep alive for yourselves all the young girls who have not known a man intimately."

Let's decode this: Kill the boy children. Kill the non-virgin women. Keep the virgin girls. In the context of ancient warfare, we know what "keep for yourselves" means. These are child sex slaves. And this isn't some barbaric soldier's initiative that God condemns—this is Moses, God's chosen prophet, giving instructions that God never contradicts.

### The Canaanite Mandate

Deuteronomy 20:16-17 lays out the general policy for the Promised Land:

> "But in the cities of these peoples that the Lord your God is giving you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes, but you shall devote them to complete destruction."

The list includes the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. Entire civilizations marked for deletion. Not because they attacked Israel—many of these cities were just living where God decided His people should live.

The crime that warrants infant murder? Geographic inconvenience.

Let's call it what it is: These are war crimes. By every definition we have, by every moral framework humans have developed, these are acts of genocide. The intentional destruction of ethnic groups including their children explicitly violates every conception of justice we hold.

And they're not presented as regrettable necessities or lesser evils. They're presented as holy acts. Righteous obedience. The will of God.
