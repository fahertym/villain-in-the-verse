# Sapphira’s Ghosts — The First Church Audit (and After)

## The Setup
Acts 5 (Ananias & Sapphira) and echoes through church history.

## The Crime
Financial opacity + fear as compliance tool.

## The Cover-Up
“God’s purity” masks organizational control.

## If a Human Did This
Nonprofit governance by threat.

## Apology Box
“They lied.” And leadership killed—without trial.

*Receipts:* Acts 5; later episodes noted

**One-liner:** Stewardship with a body count.
