# Paul’s Household Codes — Sanctifying Hierarchy

## The Setup
Ephesians/Colossians/Titus. Obey husbands, masters, rulers.

## The Crime
Embedding hierarchy into holiness.

## The Cover-Up
“Mutual submission” that somehow goes one way.

## If a Human Did This
Relabel control as care.

## Apology Box
“Context!” Sure—yet the punch lands now.

*Receipts:* Eph 5–6; Col 3–4; Titus 2

**One-liner:** The chain of command gets a halo.
