# Achan’s Family — Death by Collective Punishment

## The Setup
Joshua 7. One man hides loot from Jericho; the search expands.

## The Crime
Collective punishment: entire clan executed for one man’s theft.

## The Cover-Up
“Holy contagion” logic to justify mass penalty.

## If a Human Did This
It’s collective sentencing—illegal in modern courts, routine in this story.

## Apology Box
“They all consented.” Evidence? Or just convenient theology.

*Receipts:* Joshua 7:1–26

**One-liner:** One thief, one bonfire, whole family.
