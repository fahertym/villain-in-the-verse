# David’s Census — 70,000 Dead for a Headcount

## The Setup
2 Samuel 24 / 1 Chronicles 21. God incites a census, then condemns it.

## The Crime
A plague kills tens of thousands; policy by body count.

## The Cover-Up
“Don’t number the people”—but why incite it first?

## If a Human Did This
That’s entrapment as governance.

## Apology Box
“It taught humility.” Strange pedagogy—via mass graves.

*Receipts:* 2 Sam 24:1–25; 1 Chr 21:1–30

**One-liner:** God orders the click and blames the counter.
