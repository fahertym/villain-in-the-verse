# Hell Sayings — Eternal Torture in Jesus’s Mouth

## The Setup
Synoptics. Gehenna, outer darkness, “weeping and gnashing.”

## The Crime
Infinite punishment for finite lives.

## The Cover-Up
“Metaphor” used selectively—except when preaching fear.

## If a Human Did This
Terror governance—forever.

## Apology Box
“Justice demands it.” Justice without end is vengeance.

*Receipts:* Matt 5, 10, 13, 18, 23; Mark 9; Luke 12, 16

**One-liner:** Love that lasts forever—and so does the fire.
