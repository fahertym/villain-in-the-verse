## Chapter 17: The Bitter Water Ordeal - State-Sanctioned Trial by Abortion

Numbers 5:11-31 contains one of the Bible's most disturbing rituals that nobody talks about: divinely mandated abortion-by-curse for suspected adultery. Yes, you read that right. The same God who supposedly hates abortion prescribes one—but only when a man suspects his wife of cheating.

This isn't pro-life. It's not pro-choice. It's pro-control, where women's bodies become crime scenes investigated through forced consumption of "bitter water" that causes miscarriage if guilt is determined by... magic? Divine intervention? Priestly chemistry? The text never clarifies, because clarity isn't the point. Control is.

### The Setup: Jealousy as Justice

"If any man's wife goes astray and breaks faith with him... or if the spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife who has not defiled herself..."

Notice that? A woman can be subjected to this ordeal either for actual adultery OR just because her husband feels jealous. No evidence required. No witnesses needed. Just male emotion as probable cause for forced chemical consumption that might kill her fetus.

The husband brings his wife to the priest with an offering of barley flour—no oil or frankincense, because this is a "grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, bringing iniquity to remembrance."

Translation: Here's some cheap grain, now curse my wife because I feel suspicious.

### The Ritual: Psychological and Physical Torture

The priest brings the woman before the Lord, uncovers her head (public humiliation), and makes her hold the grain offering while he prepares the bitter water:

1. Takes holy water in an earthen vessel
2. Adds dust from the tabernacle floor
3. Writes curses on a scroll
4. Scrapes the curses into the water
5. Makes the woman drink curse-infused dirt water

The woman must say "Amen, Amen" to curses that include:
- "The Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people"
- "When the Lord makes your thigh fall away and your body swell"
- "May this water that brings the curse pass into your bowels and make your womb swell and your thigh fall away"

"Thigh falling away" is a euphemism. It means miscarriage. This is forced abortion as trial by ordeal.

### The Double Standard From Hell

If the woman is guilty (determined how? the text doesn't say), she miscarries and becomes "a curse among her people."

If she's innocent, "she shall be free and shall conceive children."

But notice what's missing: What happens to the man if he falsely accuses? Nothing. What if he's the adulterer? No ritual for him. What if he's wrong? No consequences.

A man can subject his wife to public humiliation, forced consumption of curse-water, and potential miscarriage based on nothing but jealousy, and if she's innocent, he faces zero punishment for the false accusation.

Meanwhile, if she's guilty, she loses her pregnancy, her reputation, and probably her life (given how adulteresses were typically treated).

### God's Abortion Clinic

Let's be crystal clear about what this is: God prescribing abortion as punishment for suspected adultery. The same God who will later have His followers claim life begins at conception is here ending pregnancies through curse-induced miscarriage.

But it's worse than that. This is:
- Abortion without the woman's consent
- Abortion as criminal punishment
- Abortion by religious ritual
- Abortion where only the woman suffers consequences

The pro-life movement quotes the Bible while ignoring that God Himself prescribes abortion—just only when men control it.

### The Control Mechanism

This ritual isn't about adultery or even jealousy. It's about power:

**Men control women's bodies**: A husband can force his wife through this based on feelings

**Priests control families**: They administer the ritual, interpret the results

**Fear controls behavior**: Any woman could be subjected to this at any time

**God controls reproduction**: Fertility becomes divine reward or punishment

Every woman lives knowing that jealousy—not even evidence, just jealousy—could subject her to public humiliation and forced miscarriage. It's reproductive terrorism as social control.

### The Modern Echoes

This ancient ritual still reverberates:

- Purity culture that obsesses over women's sexuality while ignoring men's
- Opposition to women's reproductive autonomy except when men/state control it
- Using pregnancy as punishment for sexual behavior
- Treating women's bodies as public property requiring male oversight
- Religious justification for controlling women's healthcare

Every law that restricts women's reproductive choices while protecting men's echoes the bitter water ordeal. Every double standard about sexual behavior runs this same program.

### What This Reveals About "Biblical Values"

When people say we need to return to "biblical values," this is in the package:
- Women as property to be tested
- Jealousy as grounds for medical assault
- Forced abortion when men approve it
- Public humiliation as justice
- Zero consequences for false accusations by men

The Bible isn't pro-life or pro-choice. It's pro-male control over female reproduction, with God as the enforcement mechanism.

**If a Human Did This**: If any modern society forced women to drink potentially poisonous substances to test fidelity, causing miscarriages for suspected adultery, we'd call it forced abortion, medical torture, and crimes against humanity.

**Apology Box**: "But this protected innocent women from false accusations!"
By forcing them to drink curse-water that might cause miscarriage? That's like saying Russian roulette protects innocent people because the gun might not fire. Also, where's the protection for men falsely accused? Oh right, they're never tested.

**Exhibit A**: Numbers 5:21-22—"The priest shall make the woman take an oath, saying, 'If no man has lain with you... be free from this water of bitterness that brings the curse. But if you have gone astray... the Lord make you a curse and an oath among your people, when the Lord makes your thigh fall away and your body swell.'" God prescribing abortion by curse for suspected adultery.
