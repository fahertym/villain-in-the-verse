## Chapter 20: Apologetics Bingo - Defending the Indefensible Since Forever

> **Figure:**



Every atrocity in the Bible comes with a ready-made excuse. Two thousand years of theology has produced a defense for everything from genocide to bear maulings. These aren't explanations—they're elaborate misdirections designed to make you stop thinking about the obvious horror.

Let's play Apologetics Bingo. Get five in a row of these classic defenses, and you win... nothing. Because these aren't answers. They're admissions that the behavior is so indefensible it requires reality-bending rhetoric to justify.

### "Mysterious Ways" - The Ultimate Non-Answer

When God does something that would be evil if anyone else did it, it becomes "mysterious." Not wrong, not cruel—mysterious. It's the theological equivalent of "I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you," except God already killed a bunch of people and still won't explain.

- Why did babies drown in the flood? *Mysterious ways.*
- Why does God harden hearts then punish them? *Mysterious ways.*
- Why create Satan knowing what would happen? *Mysterious ways.*

If mystery justifies everything, it explains nothing. It's admission of moral bankruptcy dressed up as spiritual depth.

### "Context!" - The Time Machine Defense

Apologists love to claim we're taking things "out of context." The context they provide usually makes it worse:

**Without context**: God orders genocide.
**With context**: God orders genocide because those people had different religious practices.

**Without context**: God kills kids for mocking a prophet.
**With context**: God kills kids for mocking a prophet in a city with pagan altars.

**Without context**: Slavery is permitted.
**With context**: Slavery is permitted with detailed regulations about how hard you can beat them.

Context doesn't fix atrocity—it just explains the excuses people made at the time.

### "Free Will" - The Rigged Game Excuse

God can't prevent evil because free will! Except:

- He hardened Pharaoh's heart (so much for free will)
- He knows every choice before it's made (so how free is it?)
- He intervenes selectively (free will for genociders, death for Uzzah)
- He punishes thought crimes (lusting = adultery)

Free will is invoked when God wants to avoid responsibility but ignored when He wants to take credit. It's not a principle—it's a convenience.

### "Old Testament vs New Testament" - The Personality Disorder Defense

"That's the OLD Testament. God changed!"

Did He though? The same God who drowned the world now promises to burn it. The same God who killed firstborns now threatens eternal torment. The management style shifted from immediate execution to infinite torture. That's not character development—it's escalation.

Plus, if God is unchanging (as the Bible claims), then Old Testament God IS New Testament God. You can't have an unchanging God who fundamentally changed.

### "Greater Good" - The Ends Justify the Means

Every horror serves a "greater purpose":

- Job's children died to win a bet that demonstrated... something
- Canaanite babies were killed to give Israel land for... reasons
- Jesus was tortured to satisfy rules God made about... justice?

If you're omnipotent, you can achieve any good without evil. That's what omnipotent means. Choosing the path with maximum suffering isn't greater good—it's preference for cruelty.

### "Metaphorical" - The Retreat Position

When the text becomes too horrible to defend literally, suddenly it's metaphorical:

- The flood is metaphor (for what, mass murder?)
- Job is allegory (torture porn as wisdom literature?)
- Hell is symbolic (of what, infinite symbolic torment?)

Funny how it's only metaphorical when it's embarrassing. The resurrection? Totally literal. The bear mauling? Must be symbolic. The interpretation changes based on what's defensible, not what the text says.

### "Human Standards Don't Apply" - The Moral Relativism Card

"You can't judge God by human standards!"

Then how do we judge anything? If human standards don't apply to God, then words like "good," "just," and "loving" mean nothing when applied to Him. You can't claim God is good using human concepts then say human concepts don't apply when He acts evil.

Either morality is objective (in which case God violates it constantly) or it's relative (in which case calling God "good" is meaningless).

### "You're Taking It Too Literally" - The Sophistication Shame

When you point out the obvious horror, you're told you're being unsophisticated, fundamentalist, or shallow. Real theologians understand the nuance that makes drowning babies actually loving.

It's intellectual gaslighting: if you see the atrocity clearly, you're not smart enough. Only those who can perform the mental gymnastics to justify genocide are truly enlightened.

### Your Bingo Card Is Full

Every square is an admission that the behavior described is so obviously wrong it requires extraordinary rhetoric to defend. No one needs elaborate apologetics for actual good behavior. You don't need mysterious ways to explain helping someone. You don't need context to justify healing. You don't need metaphorical interpretation for acts of genuine love.

The very existence of apologetics proves the point: the God of the Bible behaves so badly that it takes two thousand years of excuse-making to make it seem acceptable. And even then, it only works if you stop thinking about what you're actually defending.
