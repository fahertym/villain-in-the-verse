## Chapter 33: If Omnis Are Real - The Trilemma That Breaks the System

The biblical God claims three "omni" attributes that, when combined with the reality of suffering, create an unsolvable logical problem. It's called the Problem of Evil, and despite centuries of theological gymnastics, it remains the skeleton key that unlocks the whole façade.

If God is truly omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), and omnibenevolent (all-good), then evil cannot exist. But evil does exist. Therefore, either God lacks one of these attributes, or He doesn't exist at all. There's no third option where all three attributes coexist with evil—it's logically impossible, like a square circle or a married bachelor.

### The Trilemma Visualized

Imagine three points of a triangle:
- **Omnipotence**: God can do anything
- **Omniscience**: God knows everything  
- **Omnibenevolence**: God wants only good

Now add the undeniable reality: Evil exists.

For evil to exist, one of these must be false:
- God wants to prevent evil but can't (not omnipotent)
- God could prevent evil but doesn't want to (not omnibenevolent)
- God doesn't know about evil (not omniscient)

There's no configuration where all three attributes remain intact while children die of cancer.

### Testing Omnipotence

If God is all-powerful, He can:
- Create universes with free will but without evil
- Design humans who choose freely but never choose harm
- Prevent suffering without violating any principle
- Achieve any goal through infinite possible means

But children still get bone cancer. Tsunamis still destroy innocents. Birth defects still condemn babies to agony.

Either God cannot prevent these (not omnipotent) or chooses not to (not omnibenevolent). Power unused to prevent suffering is either nonexistent or malevolent.

The apologetic response—"God can't create logical contradictions like square circles"—fails because a world with free will but no suffering isn't logically contradictory. We can imagine it, describe it, desire it. If we can conceive it but God can't create it, He's not omnipotent.

### Testing Omniscience

If God is all-knowing, He:
- Knew before creation every evil that would occur
- Saw every child rape before creating the rapist
- Anticipated every genocide before making humanity
- Foresaw every moment of suffering before saying "Let there be light"

Creating a universe knowing the precise evils it will contain makes you responsible for those evils. It's like building a house with a hidden torture chamber, knowing exactly who will be tortured there, then claiming innocence because you're not personally doing the torturing.

If God didn't know evil would result, He's not omniscient. If He did know and created anyway, He's not omnibenevolent. Knowledge plus power plus evil equals complicity.

### Testing Omnibenevolence

If God is all-good, He would:
- Want to prevent all suffering
- Never cause unnecessary pain
- Always choose the least harmful option
- Prioritize wellbeing over everything else

But the Bible shows God:
- Drowning babies (Flood)
- Ordering genocide (Canaan)
- Torturing the righteous (Job)
- Creating hell (eternal suffering)
- Hardening hearts to justify punishment (Pharaoh)

These aren't the actions of infinite love. They're the actions of a being either indifferent to suffering or actively causing it. Omnibenevolence is incompatible with "I will make you eat your children" (Leviticus 26:29).

### The Free Will Defense Fails

The most common apologetic is that evil exists because God gave us free will, and free will necessarily allows evil. This fails multiple ways:

**Natural evil**: Earthquakes don't have free will. Cancer doesn't choose. Tsunamis aren't moral agents. These evils exist without any free will involvement.

**Heavenly contradiction**: Heaven supposedly has free will but no evil. If that's possible there, it's possible here.

**Prevention without violation**: God could prevent evil actions without removing free will—like making bullets pass through innocents harmlessly, or making rape physically impossible while leaving the will intact.

**Inconsistent intervention**: God violates free will constantly in the Bible (hardening hearts, sending evil spirits, controlling minds). He just doesn't do it to prevent suffering.

### The "Greater Good" Defense Fails

Another defense: Evil serves a greater good we can't perceive. This fails because:

**Omnipotence means no necessary evil**: An all-powerful being can achieve any good without evil. If God needs evil to accomplish good, He's not omnipotent.

**Unfalsifiable excuse**: "Secret greater good" explains everything and therefore nothing. It could justify any atrocity.

**Demonstrates moral bankruptcy**: If children being tortured serves a greater good, then "good" has lost all meaning.

**Contradicts biblical examples**: Much biblical evil serves no greater good—Job's children stay dead, genocide victims aren't resurrected, hell is eternal.

### The Soul-Making Defense Fails

The claim that suffering builds character fails because:

**Excessive suffering breaks rather than builds**: Severe trauma doesn't improve people—it destroys them.

**Innocents can't learn**: What character does an infant dying in agony develop?

**Unequal distribution**: Some get minor challenges, others get holocaust. That's not education—it's arbitrary torture.

**Better methods exist**: An omnipotent God could build character without suffering, like we can learn without being tortured.

### What the Trilemma Reveals

When you work through the logic, only these options remain:

**Option 1: God is not omnipotent**
He wants to prevent evil but can't. He's trying His best with limited power. This makes Him sympathetic but not worthy of worship as described biblically.

**Option 2: God is not omniscient**
He didn't foresee evil when creating. He's surprised by suffering. This makes Him incompetent and not the God of the Bible.

**Option 3: God is not omnibenevolent**
He could prevent evil but chooses not to. He either doesn't care about suffering or actively causes it. This makes Him evil—the villain of the story.

**Option 4: God doesn't exist**
The combination of claimed attributes is fictional. The story is myth, not reality.

There's no Option 5 where all three omnis coexist with evil. Logic doesn't allow it.

### The Biblical God Fails All Three

Looking at scripture, the biblical God actually fails all three tests:

**Not omnipotent**: Can't defeat iron chariots (Judges 1:19), needs rest (Genesis 2:2), requires blood sacrifice to forgive.

**Not omniscient**: Regrets creating humans (Genesis 6:6), tests Abraham to "know" his faith, asks Adam "Where are you?"

**Not omnibenevolent**: Orders genocide, creates hell, tortures Job, sends evil spirits, hardens hearts.

The Bible itself refutes the omni claims, showing a God who's powerful but not all-powerful, knowing but not all-knowing, and definitely not all-good.

### The Implications

If the omnis are false, then:
- Prayer to an non-omnipotent God might not work
- Prophecy from a non-omniscient God might be wrong
- Worship of a non-omnibenevolent God might be dangerous
- Faith in a being lacking these attributes might be misplaced

The entire theological structure collapses. A God without the omnis isn't the biblical God—it's something else, something less, something that doesn't match what's being sold.

### The Escape Attempt

The only theological escape is to abandon logic itself—to claim that contradictions can be true "in God's reality" or that "divine logic transcends human logic."

But if logic doesn't apply to God, then:
- We can't make any claims about Him (including that He's good)
- Theology becomes meaningless (all statements could be true and false)
- Faith becomes arbitrary (no reason to believe anything)
- The Bible becomes incomprehensible (words have no stable meaning)

Abandoning logic to save God means destroying the possibility of knowing anything about God.

### The Conclusion Is Inescapable

The Problem of Evil isn't a puzzle to solve—it's a proof of incoherence. The biblical God, as described with all three omni attributes, cannot exist in a world containing evil.

Since evil undeniably exists, either:
- God lacks at least one omni attribute (making Him not the biblical God)
- God doesn't exist at all

There's no logical space for an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God in a world where children die of cancer. The trilemma isn't a challenge to faith—it's a mathematical proof that the biblical God is impossible.
