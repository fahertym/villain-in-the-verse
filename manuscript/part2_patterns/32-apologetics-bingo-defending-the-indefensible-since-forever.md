## Chapter 32: Apologetics Bingo - Defending the Indefensible Since Forever

Christian apologetics is the art of defending God's atrocities with word games, logical fallacies, and emotional manipulation. It's a 2,000-year tradition of explaining why genocide, torture, and eternal damnation are actually loving if you just squint right and abandon critical thinking.

Let's play Apologetics Bingo with the greatest hits—the defensive moves deployed whenever someone points out that the God of the Bible consistently behaves like the villain of the story.

### B1: "God's Ways Are Higher Than Our Ways"

**Translation**: "Stop thinking about it."

**When deployed**: Whenever divine behavior is obviously immoral

**Why it fails**: If God's morality is incomprehensible to humans, then we can't actually know if He's good. Maybe His "higher ways" are actually evil ways we're too limited to recognize as evil. This defense destroys the possibility of knowing anything about God's character.

**Example**: "Sure, God ordered babies murdered, but His ways are higher!"
If murdering babies can be "higher," then words have no meaning.

### B2: "You're Taking It Out of Context"

**Translation**: "Read the surrounding atrocities for perspective."

**When deployed**: When someone quotes God doing something horrible

**Why it fails**: The context usually makes it worse. "God ordered genocide" doesn't improve with context like "They were pagans" or "It was a different time." Contextualized evil is still evil.

**Example**: "Lot offering his daughters to rapists needs context!"
The context: He was protecting angels. That... doesn't help.

### B3: "That's the Old Testament"

**Translation**: "God had a character development arc."

**When deployed**: When Old Testament atrocities are mentioned

**Why it fails**: Jesus explicitly said He came not to abolish the law but fulfill it. Also, Revelation shows God planning eternal torture for most humans. The New Testament God threatens infinite punishment instead of finite—that's escalation, not improvement.

**Example**: "God doesn't order genocides anymore!"
No, now He just tortures people forever for wrong belief.

### B4: "Free Will Explains Everything"

**Translation**: "You chose this suffering by existing with choice."

**When deployed**: When questioning why evil exists

**Why it fails**: Free will doesn't explain bone cancer in children, natural disasters, or mental illness. Also, God repeatedly violates free will in scripture (hardening Pharaoh's heart, sending evil spirits, controlling minds).

**Example**: "Suffering exists because free will!"
Did the Egyptian firstborns freely will their death?

### B5: "God Is Beyond Human Judgment"

**Translation**: "Rules don't apply to rulers."

**When deployed**: When someone judges God by His own moral standards

**Why it fails**: If God is beyond judgment, then calling Him "good" is meaningless. You can't have it both ways—either He's judgeable as good (and therefore as evil), or He's beyond all moral categories including goodness.

**Example**: "Who are you to judge God?"
Who is anyone to call Him good, then?

### I1: "It's Metaphorical/Symbolic"

**Translation**: "It didn't really happen, but learn from it anyway."

**When deployed**: When the literal reading is indefensible

**Why it fails**: What's the metaphor of divine genocide supposed to teach? Also, believers switch between literal and metaphorical whenever convenient. The resurrection is literal, but the genocides are metaphorical?

**Example**: "The flood is symbolic!"
Symbolic of what—God's willingness to drown everyone?

### I2: "You Have to Have Faith"

**Translation**: "Stop thinking and just believe."

**When deployed**: When logic fails completely

**Why it fails**: Faith isn't a pathway to truth—it's a surrender of the tools that find truth. You can have faith in anything. Faith in false things doesn't make them true.

**Example**: "Have faith that genocide was necessary!"
That's not faith—that's moral surrender.

### I3: "Look at the Prophecies Fulfilled"

**Translation**: "Prediction validates atrocity."

**When deployed**: To prove divine authority

**Why it fails**: Even if prophecies were fulfilled (debatable), accurately predicting something doesn't make you moral. A mob boss who says "I'll break your legs Tuesday" and does it isn't good because his prophecy came true.

**Example**: "The Bible predicted Israel would return!"
And? That justifies drowning toddlers?

### I4: "Without God, There's No Morality"

**Translation**: "My imaginary friend is the only source of ethics."

**When deployed**: When someone suggests God is immoral

**Why it fails**: We judge God as immoral using moral intuitions. If those intuitions are valid enough to recognize God as good, they're valid enough to recognize Him as evil. Also, divine command theory makes morality arbitrary—anything God commands becomes good, including genocide.

**Example**: "You can't call God evil without God's morality!"
Then you can't call Him good either.

### I5: "Sin Deserves Death"

**Translation**: "You had it coming by existing."

**When deployed**: Justifying any punishment

**Why it fails**: God created the concept of sin, the capacity for sin, the punishment for sin, and the beings who sin. It's punishing others for your own design flaws. Also, proportionality matters—infinite punishment for finite crimes is unjust by definition.

**Example**: "We all deserve death for sin!"
Infants deserve death for inherited sin? That's justice?

### N1: "God Knows Best"

**Translation**: "Trust the authority figure blindly."

**When deployed**: When divine behavior seems harmful

**Why it fails**: Every dictator's followers say this. "The Dear Leader knows best." Without the ability to evaluate whether someone knows best, the claim is meaningless.

**Example**: "God knew those Canaanite babies needed to die!"
Then God's knowledge includes when baby murder is good?

### N2: "Look at Nature's Beauty"

**Translation**: "Ignore the parasites and focus on sunsets."

**When deployed**: As evidence of God's goodness

**Why it fails**: Nature is mostly things eating other things alive. For every sunset, there's a parasitic wasp laying eggs in a living caterpillar. Nature is amoral chaos, not evidence of benevolent design.

**Example**: "How can you see a butterfly and not believe in God's love?"
How can you see a child dying of leukemia and believe in it?

### N3: "Many Smart People Believed"

**Translation**: "Smart people can't be wrong about this."

**When deployed**: Appeal to authority

**Why it fails**: Smart people believe contradictory things. Newton believed in alchemy. Intelligence doesn't prevent error. Also, many smart people didn't believe.

**Example**: "C.S. Lewis was brilliant and believed!"
Bertrand Russell was brilliant and didn't.

### N4: "It Gives People Comfort"

**Translation**: "Useful lies are better than hard truths."

**When deployed**: When truth claims fail

**Why it fails**: Comfort doesn't make something true. Heroin provides comfort too. Also, it provides comfort by threatening eternal torture—that's comfort like a protection racket provides safety.

**Example**: "Faith helps people through hard times!"
So does denial. Neither makes the belief true.

### N5: "You Just Want to Sin"

**Translation**: "Your motivation invalidates your argument."

**When deployed**: When arguments fail, attack the arguer

**Why it fails**: Ad hominem fallacy. Even if someone wants to sin, that doesn't make God's genocides moral. Also, recognizing evil isn't about wanting to sin—it's about having functioning moral intuitions.

**Example**: "You only reject God to live however you want!"
Or maybe ordering child murder is actually wrong?

### G1: "Mysterious Ways"

**Translation**: "I can't explain this atrocity, so... mystery!"

**When deployed**: The last resort when nothing else works

**Why it fails**: "Mystery" isn't an answer—it's an admission that you don't have an answer. Calling evil mysterious doesn't make it good.

**Example**: "God works in mysterious ways!"
Serial killers work in mysterious ways too.

### G2: "God Sacrificed His Son For You"

**Translation**: "God hurt Himself to save you from Himself."

**When deployed**: To inspire guilt and gratitude

**Why it fails**: God sacrificing Himself to Himself to save us from Himself isn't love—it's a protection racket with theatrical elements. Also, temporary death of an immortal being isn't much sacrifice.

**Example**: "How can you reject Someone who died for you?"
I didn't ask Him to. He created the problem and the solution.

### G3: "Every Knee Will Bow"

**Translation**: "You'll submit eventually, voluntarily or not."

**When deployed**: As a threat disguised as prophecy

**Why it fails**: Forced worship isn't worship—it's domination. Every knee bowing to a tyrant doesn't make the tyrant good.

**Example**: "One day you'll acknowledge God's glory!"
At gunpoint, anyone acknowledges anything.

### G4: "Satan Is the Real Enemy"

**Translation**: "Blame God's employee for God's system."

**When deployed**: To deflect from divine evil

**Why it fails**: Satan operates with God's permission (see Job). God created Satan knowing exactly what would happen. The puppet master is responsible for the puppet show.

**Example**: "Satan causes suffering, not God!"
Who created Satan? Who allows him to operate?

### G5: "You're Angry at God"

**Translation**: "Your emotions invalidate your logic."

**When deployed**: To psychologize away arguments

**Why it fails**: One can be angry at fictional villains. Anger at a character doesn't make the character real or good. Also, shouldn't we be angry at depicted genocide?

**Example**: "You're just mad at God!"
I'm mad at the character as written, like being mad at Voldemort.

### O1: "Personal Experience Proves It"

**Translation**: "My feelings override your facts."

**When deployed**: When evidence is requested

**Why it fails**: Personal experience "proves" every religion and delusion. Feelings aren't facts. Brain chemistry isn't theology.

**Example**: "I felt God's presence!"
Others feel Allah's, Krishna's, or their medication working.

### O2: "What If You're Wrong?"

**Translation**: "Pascal's Wager: Bet on God just in case."

**When deployed**: Final desperation move

**Why it fails**: What if you're wrong about which God? What if God values honest disbelief over coerced faith? What if the real God punishes believers for gullibility?

**Example**: "Better safe than sorry—believe!"
Which of the 4,000 religions should I pick to be safe?

### O3: "The Bible Says..."

**Translation**: "This book is true because this book says so."

**When deployed**: As circular evidence

**Why it fails**: Every holy book claims truth. Self-attestation isn't evidence. Spider-Man comics say Spider-Man exists.

**Example**: "The Bible says God is good!"
The Bible also says He orders genocide. Which claim wins?

### O4: "Love the Sinner, Hate the Sin"

**Translation**: "I'm judging you with a smile."

**When deployed**: To seem loving while condemning

**Why it fails**: When the "sin" is someone's identity, nature, or existence, you're hating them, not some separate behavior. Also, God doesn't separate the two—He tortures whole persons, not just their sins.

**Example**: "God loves you but hates your homosexuality!"
That's like saying "I love you but hate your eye color."

### O5: "It's Not Religion, It's Relationship"

**Translation**: "Our control system is different because we say so."

**When deployed**: To avoid religion's bad reputation

**Why it fails**: It's a relationship where one party has all the power, makes all the rules, punishes questioning, and threatens eternal torture for leaving. That's not a relationship—that's captivity.

**Example**: "Christianity isn't religion, it's relationship with God!"
An abusive relationship is still abusive.

### BINGO!

If you've heard five or more of these in a single conversation, congratulations—you've won Apologetics Bingo! Your prize: Recognition that defending the indefensible requires increasingly absurd mental gymnastics.

These aren't arguments—they're thought-terminating clichés designed to end examination rather than enable it. They're the defensive moves of a system that can't withstand scrutiny, so it forbids scrutiny instead.

The very need for such elaborate defenses reveals the truth: If God's behavior was actually good, it wouldn't require 2,000 years of creative explanation for why it looks exactly like evil.
