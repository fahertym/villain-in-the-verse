## Chapter 22: The Gerasene Swine - Jesus Destroys a Town's Economy

Mark 5 (paralleled in Matthew 8 and Luke 8) gives us Jesus the economic terrorist, where the Son of God destroys an entire region's livestock industry to perform an exorcism that could have been done without mass animal cruelty and financial devastation. It's salvation through property destruction, where helping one person requires ruining hundreds.

This isn't compassionate healing. It's collateral damage as ministry model, where innocent bystanders pay the price for miracles they didn't request.

### The Setup: Legion Meets Livestock

Jesus crosses the Sea of Galilee and encounters a demon-possessed man living among tombs. The man is in terrible shape—cutting himself with stones, crying out night and day, unable to be restrained even with chains. He needs help, genuinely.

The demons inside him (calling themselves "Legion" because they are many) recognize Jesus and beg not to be tormented. Here's where it gets economically violent:

"Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him, saying, 'Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.'"

Jesus agrees. "So he gave them permission."

The demons enter the pigs—about 2,000 of them according to Mark—and the entire herd rushes down the steep bank into the sea and drowns.

### The Economic Apocalypse Nobody Discusses

Two thousand pigs. Let's calculate the devastation:

In first-century economics, a pig was worth approximately 30 denarii. A denarius was a day's wage for a laborer. So one pig = one month's wages.

2,000 pigs × 30 denarii = 60,000 denarii = 60,000 days of labor = approximately 164 years of wages

Jesus just destroyed 164 years' worth of working-class income. In thirty seconds.

This wasn't one person's herd. A herd that size required multiple owners, numerous employees—herders, feeders, processors. Entire families just lost their livelihoods. Children will go hungry. Debts can't be paid. Workers are instantly unemployed.

### The Innocent Victims

Let's count who suffers:

**The pig owners**: Just lost everything. No insurance in first-century Palestine. Bankruptcy isn't a fresh start; it's starvation.

**The employees**: Herders, feeders, butchers—all instantly jobless in an economy with no unemployment benefits.

**The consumers**: Pork prices just skyrocketed due to supply elimination. Poor families can't afford protein.

**The pigs**: 2,000 sentient animals drowned in terror. They didn't choose demon possession. They died in panic and confusion.

**The regional economy**: A major industry just collapsed. Ripple effects will last years.

Meanwhile, who benefits? One guy. One. The possessed man is healed (good!), but at the cost of economic devastation for hundreds (evil!).

### The Town's Reasonable Response

"The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened... And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region."

Of course they wanted Him gone! He just destroyed their economy! This isn't rejection of the divine—it's the rational response to someone who ruins your livelihood. If someone came to your town, healed one person, but destroyed the largest employer in the process, you'd want them gone too.

But this gets painted as the people choosing pigs over salvation. No—they're choosing survival over the guy who just proved He'll destroy their property without consent or compensation.

### The Theological Problems

This story breaks Jesus's own teachings:

**"Love your neighbor"**—How is destroying your neighbor's livelihood love?

**"Do unto others"**—Would Jesus want His carpentry business destroyed for someone else's healing?

**"Give to the poor"**—He just made hundreds of people poor

**"The worker deserves his wages"**—He just eliminated wages for dozens of workers

Jesus could have:
- Sent the demons to uninhabited wilderness
- Destroyed them outright (He's omnipotent)
- Sent them to the abyss they begged not to enter
- Exorcised them without the theatrical pig massacre

But He chose economic terrorism. He chose to make innocent people pay for one man's healing.

### What This Reveals

The Gerasene swine incident shows:

- Divine miracles can require destroying innocent livelihoods
- God values individual healing over communal economic survival
- Property rights mean nothing if heaven wants a demonstration
- Collateral damage is acceptable for spiritual victories
- The poor pay for miracles they didn't ask for

**If a Human Did This**: If a doctor healed one patient by destroying the local economy, causing massive unemployment and food insecurity, we'd call them a terrorist, not a healer. The cure would be considered worse than the disease.

**Apology Box**: "But pigs were unclean animals to Jews!"
The Gerasenes were likely Gentiles who could eat pork. And even if pigs were religiously unclean, that doesn't justify destroying people's property and livelihoods. You don't get to bankrupt people because you disapprove of their business.

**Exhibit A**: Mark 5:13—"So he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea." Two thousand animals and countless livelihoods destroyed for one healing.
